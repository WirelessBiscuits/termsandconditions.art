			<p>Terms and conditions” is an interactive nomadic installation based inside a van, exploring the idea of bringing the
				invisible data that exists around us into something somewhat tangible both visually and through audio.</p>
			<p>The amount of data that is generated and collected by the technology we use on a daily basis is staggering. 
				The problem with this data is that it is not just a single tangible object that we can point to and say "this is all the data". 
				Rather, it is a hyperobject, a vast and complex network of information that is constantly being generated and collected by a variety of sources.
				<br>This data is not just a passive object, it is an active force that is constantly shaping and reshaping the world around us. 
				 It exists not just as an abstract concept, it has real-world consequences that affect our lives in intangible ways that are difficult to ever 
				 fully comprehend.
				</p>
			<p>We hope to create an installation that will be highly immersive and engaging, where the  audience’s presence would influence the 
				audio and visual aspects of the piece based on data collected from their devices in real-time. We plan to not only focus on aspects of privacy, 
				but also more broadly the data that surrounds us—endless oscillations of electromagnetic radiation constantly surging 
				through the spaces around us making modern civilization function and our traditional understandings of our existence—that we tend to be,
				 for the most part oblivious to. We hope to investigate our conceptions of living within this inescapable technological landscape.
			</p>
			<p>The installation will incorporate a range of  synthesised mediums and techniques, including; installation, augmented reality, sound, 
				and programming. These elements will be used to create a dynamic and constantly changing environment that audiences can explore and
				 interact with. The primary physical structure of the installation inside the van will be built from electronic waste as it connects
				with the hyperobject of data and technology as a whole.
				<br>Additionally, the project will involve researching and experimenting with various methods of collecting data, 
				as well as exploring the most effective ways to utilise that data in the art piece. 
				</p>
				<p>Through a multimedia experience of augmented reality, sound and video, we aim to bring forward the possibility of 
				new perceptions in the concepts of technology and data, utilising various unique and interactive data visualisation techniques. 
				The project will also involve exploring the ethical and societal implications of harnessing and utilising data in this way.
				The project's nomadic nature will also allow for the opportunity to work with different communities in different locations, 
				providing unique perspectives and data sets to work with. This will also enable the team to explore different ways to engage with 
				audiences and create a more inclusive and community-driven project.</p>
				<p>
				Overall, the project aims to push the boundaries of what is possible with data-driven art and to create a thought-provoking 
				and impactful experience for audiences.
